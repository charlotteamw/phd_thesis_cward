# Refuge Model


Model Description & Experimental Procedure 

We employ the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model as a base consumer-resource (C-R) model. We use parameter 'q' to modify refuge habitat by modelling a gradual change between a type II to a type III functional response. When q=0, the classic Rosenzweig MacArthur model with a Type II functional response is employed and when q=1.0, the consumer exhibits a Type III functional response with a refuge (see Williams and Martinez, 2004).

We perform 2 experiments (deterministic & stochastic experiments) to analyze the stability of consumer-resource interactions in response to the addition of prey refugia. We evaluate these responses in the presence different underlying energy flux conditions among the consumer and resource population (high and low consumer biomass potential). In both experiments, the refuge parameter 'q' is varied from 0.0 (no refuge) to 1.0 (maximum refuge), while resource carrying capacity 'k' is simultaneously varied from a value of 0.0 to 8.0. We consider two contrasting cases of carrying capacity throughout the analysis which promote either low biomass potential (k= 1.2) or high biomass potential (k= 7.3).

First, we model consumer-resource interactions under a deterministic scenario and evaluate local stability (maximum real eigenvalues) and consumer population density over 100-time steps (time steps 2900 to 3000 to avoid evaluating transient dynamics).

To model consumer-resource interactions under stochastic dynamics, we perturb consumer and resource denstiies at random time intervals. We track mean consumer population density over 100-time steps, consumer population standard deviation over 100-time steps, and the co-efficient of variation (CV) in consumer density over 100-time steps.

Finally, we determine the equilibrium solutions for consumer and resource populations and plot isoclines to visualize the stability of consumer and resource densities at equilibrium across three levels of refuge strength (for high and low energy flux conditions).

# phd_thesis_cward

This repository contains the code and data for reproducing the figures and analyses from Chapters 3 to 5 of my PhD thesis. It includes all necessary scripts and datasets to replicate the analyses and visualizations presented in these chapters. The code is organized by chapter, with each folder containing the relevant scripts and data files. Note that each chapter uses different programming languages and dependencies. Chapter 5 relies on Mathematica, Chapter 3 uses Julia and R, and Chapter 4 primarily uses R for various data analysis components, including stable isotope and telemetry analyses. To reproduce the results, clone the repository, navigate to the respective chapter folder, and run the scripts. Ensure you have the appropriate environment set up for each language and install the required packages as indicated in the scripts.
